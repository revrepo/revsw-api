objects.

Build something great!


All requests are only accessible via https and the endpoint is located at
`api.revsw.net`. Depending on the request type a GET, POST, PUT or DELETE
is used. We do our best to have all our URLs be [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Every endpoint (URL) may support one of four different http verbs. GET
requests fetch information about an object, POST requests create objects,
PUT requests update objects, and finally DELETE requests will delete

## Authentication

RevAPM's supports authentication using a user's email and password
used to access. Rev system. Your API calls must include HTTP Basic
Authentication header (RFC 2617) generated from a user's email and password.
All modern browsers, as well as command line tools like curl and wget support
basic authentication. This is secure, since all communication with the Rev
service happens over SSL/HTTPS.

## Limits
Be nice. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll send back a
`503` error code (server unavailable).
There is a limit of 5000 requests per hour.
